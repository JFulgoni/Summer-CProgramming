# Summer-CProgramming
## John Fulgoni - Summer 2015

This repository holds most of the coding projects used in the "Introduction to C" class taught
at the Columbia School for Continuing Education in the Summer of 2015.

This code was used for class sessions from 29 June - 17 July, and from 21 July to 7 August.

Syllabi for the two classes can be found here:

[Seniors and Juniors (Session 1)](syllabus.pdf)

[Sophomores and Freshmen (Session 2)](syllabus2.pdf)

This course was designed by the myself and the School of Continuing Education to teach students
with no prior knowledge of coding the basics of C Programming.

(now called School of Professional Studies)
